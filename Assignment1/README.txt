The process_data.rb script is suppossed to take the ARGV in the EXACT same 
way as they were stated on the Assignment 1 task instructions on Moodle.
Also, the path to the ruby classes ('require') is set to the very same working
directory as the process_data.rb. I simply did not know what path to put.
